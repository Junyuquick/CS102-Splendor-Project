To clone project and use it in Vscode:

    1. “ Git clone https://github.com/Junyuquick/CS102-Splendor-Project.git “

    2. “ git checkout main "

    3. " git config —global user.name junyuquick “

    4. "git config —global user.email junyu...@computing.smu.edu.sg “

    Note: replace the name n email w ur own, can be anything



For subsequent uses on Vscode:

    1. Before you begin each coding session: "git pull"

    2. Once youre done, find the "COMMIT" button in Vscode, type the commit message and press it

    Note: for commit message, we can type "[filename]:[short exp of what u did] - [name]"
    • eg. "Player.java, Board.java: added attributes/methods - jun yu"
    • it’ll help us debug, and revert commits easily
    • we are not doing feature branch push as its a small project
